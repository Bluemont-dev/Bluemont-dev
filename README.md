- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bluemont-dev
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack web development
- 🌱 I have built a Node JS multiplayer card game using MongoDB, Socket.IO, hosted on Heroku. I also have built an online community using Python and PostgreSQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking for work -- full-time, part-time, contract or staff. I want to learn how work teams manage coding, testing, deployment and maintenance of their projects and products.
- 📫 You can reach me at info@bluemontcommunications.com
