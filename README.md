- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bluemont-dev
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack web development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science basics via Harvard's CS50 online course, and also building a Node JS multiplayer card game using MongoDB, Socket.IO and hosted on Heroku.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will grow my skills. I especially want to understand async/await/promise and error catching to prevent my app from crashing on the server.
- 📫 You can reach me at info@bluemontcommunications.com
